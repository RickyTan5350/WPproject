-- Project Specification --

Students’ Hall Booking System
There are three types of users: Admin, Student, and Hall Manager.
 In this system, a student books a hall (for events, meetings, etc.) by filling out a booking form in the system, and a Hall Manager will approve/reject the booking request based on the availability of the requested hall.
As the Admin, you manage the website and the database of the system. The database already contains information about all users, including their username, password, and user level.
i) User Login and Verification
- All users must log in using their assigned username and password.
- Incorrect login will be rejected.
- User verification will be handled using session management.

ii) User Management
Admin can:
- Add new users
- Edit and delete any current user information.

Hall Manager and Student can edit their own profile information (except for Identification ID, which is not editable).
(Use sessions to manage user levels and control access to different functions.)
iii) Booking a Hall
Student can:
- Fill out a booking form with required details (event name, date, time, purpose, requested hall, etc.).
- Submit the form for approval.
- The system will perform data manipulation (insert, update, delete records in the database).

iv) Approving / Rejecting Bookings
Hall Manager can:
- View submitted booking applications.
- Approve or reject bookings based on hall availability.
- Perform data manipulation (insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from multiple tables).

v) Viewing Booking Status
Student can:
- View the status of their booking application (approved, pending, rejected).

vi) Viewing Reports
Hall Manager can:
- View a sorted report (e.g. alphabetically by student name or by date) of all hall bookings.

Student can:
- View a report of only their own hall booking records.

(Use sessions to enforce user level restrictions. Enable sorting & searching functionality.)
vii) Access Control
Admin:
- Has full access to all pages.

Hall Manager and Student:
- Have limited access (for example, only Admin can add new users; this page should only be visible to Admin).
- Access control should be enforced using user levels and session management.
